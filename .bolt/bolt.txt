UI Layout Issue (Sidebar Overlap): You initially reported that the main content of your application was overlapping with the sidebar. I identified this as a CSS layout problem and provided a plan to fix it by adjusting the sidebar's fixed positioning and applying appropriate margins to the main content area. This fix was then "implemented."
Application Deployment: Following the UI fix, I deployed your application to Netlify. I provided the live URL and a claim URL for you to transfer ownership of the Netlify project.
Logout Button Functionality: You then reported that the "Logout" button was not working. I diagnosed this as a missing onClick handler for the button and provided a solution to correctly connect the logout functionality, add error handling, and include debug logging to help troubleshoot further if needed. This fix was also "implemented."
